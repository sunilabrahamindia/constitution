## Full Text

**(1)** *India, that is Bharat, shall be a Union of States.*  
**(2)** *The States and the territories thereof shall be as specified in the First Schedule.*  
**(3)** *The territory of India shall comprise —*  
- *(a) the territories of the States;*  
- *(b) the Union territories specified in the First Schedule; and*  
- *(c) such other territories as may be acquired.*

## Summary

- India has two official names: **India** and **Bharat**.  
- India is a **Union of States**, meaning States cannot secede.  
- State and Union Territory lists appear in the **First Schedule**.  
- Parliament may add newly acquired territory to India.

## Explanation

Article 1 defines the constitutional identity and territorial scope of the Republic.  
The phrase **Union of States** was chosen to emphasise unity and the absence of a right to secession.

Clause (3) states that India includes:

- all States,  
- all Union Territories, and  
- any territory India may acquire in the future.

## Historical Context

In the Constituent Assembly, members highlighted:

- the cultural and historical significance of both names — Bharat and India,  
- the need for national unity after integration of princely States,  
- flexibility for territorial reorganisation.

## Key Judicial Interpretation

- **Berubari Union Reference (1960):** Cession of Indian territory requires a constitutional amendment.  
- **State Reorganisation Cases:** Parliament has broad authority to alter State boundaries.

## Cross-References

- **Article 2** — Admission or establishment of new States.  
- **Article 3** — Alteration of areas and boundaries of States.  
- **First Schedule** — List of States and Union Territories.
