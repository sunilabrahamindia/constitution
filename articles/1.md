### Summary

- India has two official names: **India** and **Bharat**.  
- The Constitution describes India as a **Union of States**, emphasising unity and non-secession.  
- The First Schedule lists the States and Union Territories.  
- India’s territory can expand when new regions are legally acquired.

### Explanation

Article 1 is the constitutional gateway for understanding India’s territorial and federal architecture.  
The term **Union of States** was deliberately chosen by the framers to clarify that the country is not formed by an agreement among sovereign entities and that no State has the right to withdraw from the Union.  

Clause (3) provides a flexible definition of India’s territory, allowing Parliament to reorganise States or incorporate new territory without amending the Article itself.

### Historical Context

- Debates centred around whether the country should be officially called *India* or *Bharat*.  
- The expression *Union* was defended by Dr Ambedkar to ensure territorial integrity.  
- The provision needed adaptability because the political map of India was still in flux during drafting.

### Judicial Interpretation

**Berubari Union (1960)** — Supreme Court held that ceding territory requires a constitutional amendment.  

**Reorganisation cases** — Parliament has wide power to create, merge or alter States under Articles 2–4.
