## Summary
<div class="summary-box">

- States and Union territories appear in the **First Schedule**.  
- Parliament may add new territory to India.

</div>

## Explanation

Article 1 defines the constitutional identity and territorial scope of the Republic.  
The phrase *Union of States* was chosen to emphasise unity and the absence of a right to secede.

Clause (3) states that India includes:
- all States,  
- all Union territories,  
- any territory India may acquire in the future.

## Historical Context

During the Constituent Assembly debates, members highlighted:
- The cultural and historical significance of both names — Bharat and India.  
- The need for a constitutional structure that ensured national unity.  
- Flexibility for future reorganisation after integration of princely states.

## Key Judicial Interpretation

- **Berubari Union Reference (1960)**: Cession of Indian territory requires a constitutional amendment.  
- **State Reorganisation Cases**: Parliament has broad authority to alter State boundaries.

## Cross-References

- **Article 2** — Admission or establishment of new States.  
- **Article 3** — Alteration of areas, boundaries and names of States.  
- **First Schedule** — List of States and Union territories.
