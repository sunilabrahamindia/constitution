## Articles of the Constitution

The Constitution of India is organised around a sequence of Articles. Each Article sets out a specific rule, principle or institutional power. Together, they form the detailed framework through which the Constitution operates. This index lists the Articles in numerical order. Inserted and extended Articles appear alongside the main sequence for ease of reference.
