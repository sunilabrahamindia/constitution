# The Constitution of India Project

Welcome to the working edition of the Constitution of India Project. This site presents the Constitution in a clear, article-wise format, supported by notes, references, and historical context. The aim is to make the text easier to read and navigate while keeping the official version as the primary source.

This project is part of the wider Sunil Abraham Project, which brings together research, documentation, and public resources. The Constitution section here is still in its early stages, and the structure will grow as articles, parts, schedules, and commentary are added.

## What you can expect as the site develops

- Article-wise pages with clean formatting  
- Notes and background for important provisions  
- Cross-links between related articles  
- Historical context, including amendments  
- Links to official documents and authoritative sources  
- Tools for navigation and research

## Status

The site is under active development. More pages, commentary, and navigation tools will be added soon.

## Source and Attribution

The authoritative version of the Constitution of India is published by the Government of India. This project includes excerpts and references to support research and understanding. Commentary and additional material are original contributions.
