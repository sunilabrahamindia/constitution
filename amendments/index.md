## Constitutional Amendments

The Constitution of India has been amended many times since it came into force in 1950. Amendments may add new provisions, revise existing Articles, insert Schedules or make structural changes to the relationship between the Union and the States. This index lists the Constitutional Amendments in numerical order. As the project expands, each amendment will have its own page with details of the changes introduced and the Articles affected.

### Index of Amendments

- [1st Amendment](/amendments/1/)  
- [2nd Amendment](/amendments/2/)  
- [3rd Amendment](/amendments/3/)  
- [4th Amendment](/amendments/4/)  
- [5th Amendment](/amendments/5/)  
- [6th Amendment](/amendments/6/)  
- [7th Amendment](/amendments/7/)  
- [8th Amendment](/amendments/8/)  
- [9th Amendment](/amendments/9/)  
- [10th Amendment](/amendments/10/)  

This list will continue as amendment pages are added. Later amendments include major changes, such as the 42nd Amendment, the 44th Amendment, the 73rd and 74th Amendments on local government, and the more recent amendments relating to tax, reservations and constitutional status for territories.

### About this index

Each amendment page will eventually include the text of the amendment, its date of enactment, the provisions it modified and references to relevant Parts, Articles and Schedules.
