# The Constitution of India Project

This repository hosts the work for ``constitution.sunilabraham.in``. It presents the Constitution of India in a structured, article-wise format, supported by background notes, cross-references, historical context, and commentary. The aim is to make the Constitution easier to explore, study, and cite, while keeping the official text as the primary reference.

## Purpose of the Project

The Constitution is the foundation of the Indian legal and political system. Although the full text is widely available, it is often difficult to navigate, especially when looking for amendments, related articles, or contextual explanations. This project organises the Constitution into clear, accessible pages, each dedicated to a single provision, with space for commentary and supporting material.

## What This Repository Contains

- Source files for article-wise pages  
- Layouts and templates for the website  
- Metadata for parts, chapters, and schedules  
- Commentary, notes, and related references  
- Tools for navigation, search, and cross-linking  
- Build configuration for GitHub Pages

## What This Project Is Not

This project does not replace the official text of the Constitution issued by the Government of India. The authoritative version is the one published by the Legislative Department and notified in the Gazette of India. This site provides an organised and annotated interface to help readers understand and navigate the original material.

## Structure

The website will follow a simple layout:

- Home page introducing the Constitution and the project  
- Index pages for Parts, Chapters, Articles, and Schedules  
- Dedicated pages for each Article (with commentary)  
- Amendment timelines and historical notes  
- A glossary for key constitutional terms  
- External resources and references to official documents

All pages will follow a consistent format, with metadata fields, clear headings, and space for updates.

## Source of the Text

The official text of the Constitution is published by the Government of India. Wherever the site includes quotations or excerpts, those will be linked back to the official source. Commentary and explanatory notes are original material created for this project.

## Disclaimer

This project is for research, education, and public understanding. It does not constitute legal advice. For legal or professional use, please refer to the official text and consult a qualified professional.

## Part of a Larger Initiative

The Constitution project is one of the subprojects under the wider Sunil Abraham Project, which includes work on Indian law, public institutions, and digital scholarship. Each subproject follows a common structure and is developed as a public resource.
